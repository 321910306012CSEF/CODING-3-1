# Python packages 
_Python_ has so many built in packages, which have functions that help us to perform regular and complex operations. These packages also help us do things like _graphical representation, mathematical calculations_. These also help us by providing additional programing power. The python packages can be installed and used. These can be installed from the package library. Some of the libraries and packages that can be used are:

1)**_NumPy_**:
  You can do basic mathematical operations without any special Python packages. However, if you’re going to do any kind of complex math, the NumPy package will make your coding life much easier.NumPy provides tools to help build multi-dimensional arrays and perform calculations on the data stored in them. You can solve algebraic formulas, perform common statistical operations, and much more.While NumPy is a valuable Python package for a variety of general-purpose programming tasks, it’s particularly important if you want to do machine learning, since it provides part of the foundation for libraries like TensorFlow.
			
2)**_Pendulum_**:
  If you have at least a little Python programming experience, you probably know that you can use the datetime module to manage dates and times within an application.While datetime is great for basic work along these lines, the Pendulum Python package makes it easier to do more complex coding involving dates and times. It’s more intuitive to work with, and it manages time zones automatically.Best of all, Pendulum is designed to be a drop-in replacement for datetime. That means you can use it with code you’ve already written based on datetime. With only a few exceptions, Pendulum will work just as well, without the need to modify the code, while providing extra features not present in plain-old datetime.

3)**_Python Imaging Library_**:
  If your Python application interacts with images in any way, the Python imaging library, also known as PIL or Pillow, is a Python must-have. It makes it easy to write code that opens, modifies, and saves images in a variety of formats.If you’re doing more advanced work with images (like image recognition, in which case OpenCV would be a good package to consider), Pillow won’t cut it on its own. But for basic image importing, manipulation, and exporting, Pillow is your go-to solution.

4)**_MoviePy_**:
  MoviePy is to videos what Pillow is to images. It provides a range of functionality for common tasks associated with importing, modifying, and exporting video files. It also lets you do things like insert titles into videos or rotate videos 90 degrees .Like Pillow, MoviePy is not intended as a tool for advanced data manipulation. If you’re writing a video editing app, you’ll probably also need to rely on OpenCV (which can work with videos as well as images) to provide the advanced functionality that MoviePy lacks. But for most standard tasks involving videos in Python code, MoviePy gets the job done quite well.

5)**_Pandas_**:
  There is a long list of Python packages designed for working with complex data sets. But arguably, Pandas is the most important. Pandas helps you manipulate and analyze large sets of data without having to learn a specialized data-processing language like R.Pandas has its limits in that it’s not intended for advanced statistical modelling (in that case, you would want to learn R, or use a Python package like statsmodels). But if you need to do things like process time-series data or perform statistical analysis on a data set, Pandas has you covered.

***_Instaling Packages_***:
Python packages can be installed if not already done. We can install a python package using "pip".
Syntax to install a package using pip:
***_
`!pip install package_name`
_***

After installation, you can see a success message in the last line. This means the package can now be imported and used in your code.
