India, A _1.3 billion_ populated country with one of the _best economic reforms_ and _ecological benefits_ is yet to reach the status of a developed country, But countries like America with less than _half-billion_ has reached the top of the world economy. Better reforms would have been truly very useful if the system was well maintained. In India, any benefit to the people goes through so many hierarchical stages and many hands, this is where the analysis and fault detection is tough.

The _Indian people's welfare system_ is too much _levelled_. The Government first gives the assurance and the required money to help peoples needs with the _budget_, but this is _never verified_ by either people or by the government about how the money is flowing and to whom. After the release of money, the government calls for a _contract based biding_ to give the chance of doing development work to the contractor. Here the bid with less cost is considered to save money. But the contractors quote a comfortable estimate from which , most flows to their accounts and teh left carpous amount goes to the people. Similarly, each levels operator has his piece of the cake made for the people. 

Now people might feel that this is how works are done here, Yes this is how work is done but who accepted and agreed with this?!, all these known _common things_ are not accepted but are made to accept. And what do people do?, Just watch a web series about _a criminal politician_ or a movie about a _fraud leader_ taken down by someone good and just feel that these are just for movies. For your enlightenment movies are _made from real societies faults_. But we the people don't want anything to be done by us but need some change.

_Change without any effort is impossible in the universe_. So it would be wise if people start reacting to the _silent sins_ well known in the society, make people-driven reforms again and fight back any suppression or fault in the system. Once you reach people around will start listening, the ones you react your voice will multiply, the ones you react Governments hear and then things start to change. Once India starts to block corruption in its society, it could generate _double the economy_ produced now. **_People must react.................just......react_**.
